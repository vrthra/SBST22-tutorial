    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "An Earley parser executes the following steps for parsing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `<start>` as the entry into parsing. At this point, we want to parse the\n",
    "given string by the nonterminal `<start>`. The _definition_ of `<start>`\n",
    "contains the possible expansion rule that can match the given string. Each\n",
    "expansion rule can be thought of as a *parsing path*, with contiguous\n",
    "substrings of the given input string matched by the particular terms in the\n",
    "rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When given a nonterminal to match the string, the essential idea is to\n",
    "  get the rules in the definition, and add them to the current set of\n",
    "  parsing paths to try with the given string. Within the parsing path, we have\n",
    "  a parsed index which denotes the progress of parsing that particular path\n",
    "  (i.e the point till which the string until now has been recognized by that\n",
    "  path, and any parents of this path). When a rule is newly added, this parsed\n",
    "  index is set to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We next look at our set of possible parsing paths, and check if any of these\n",
    "  paths start with a nonterminal. If one is found, then for that parsing path to\n",
    "  be completed with the given string, that nonterminal has to be recognized\n",
    "  first. So, we add the expansion rules corresponding to that nonterminal to the\n",
    "  list of possible parsing paths. We do this recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now, examine the current letter in the input. Then select all parsing paths\n",
    "  that have that particular letter at the parsed index. These expressions can\n",
    "  now advance one step to the next index. We add such parsing paths to the\n",
    "  set of parsing paths to try for the next character.\n",
    "\n",
    "* While doing this, any parsing paths have finished parsing, fetch its\n",
    "  corresponding nonterminal and advance all parsing paths that have that\n",
    "  nonterminal at the parsing index.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Continue recursively until the parsing path corresponding to `<start>` has\n",
    "  finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The chart parser depends on a chart (a table) for parsing. The columns\n",

    "### The Chart Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we begin the chart construction by \n",
    "seeding the chart with columns representing the tokens or characters.\n",
    "Consider our example grammar again. The starting point is,\n",
    "```\n",
    "   <start>: | <A> <B>\n",
    "```\n",
    "We add this state to the `chart[0]` to start the parse. Note that the term\n",
    "after dot is `<A>`, which will need to be recursively inserted to the column.\n",
    "We will see how to do that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* In traditional Earley parsing, the starting nonterminal always have\n",
    "a single expansion rule. However, in many cases, you want to parse a fragment\n",
    "and this rule makes it cumbersome to use Earley parsing. Hence, we have\n",
    "opted to allow any nonterminal to be used as the starting nonterminal\n",
    "irrespective of whether it has a single rule or not.\n",
    "Interestingly, this does not have an impact on the parsing itself, but in\n",
    "the extraction of results.\n",
    "In essence, we seed *all* expansion rules into of the current start symbol\n",
    "to the chart at `column 0`. We will take care of that difference while\n",
    "building parse trees."
