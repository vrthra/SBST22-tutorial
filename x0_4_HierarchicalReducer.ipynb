    "  * The highest priority is given to the smallest tree.\n",

    "  * In case of tie break, the shallowest subnode gets the highest priority (i.e child has higher priority over grand child, and empty node has the highest priority since it is a peer of the current node).\n",
    "2. We pick each nodes, and find compatible subnodes that reproduce the failure.\n",
    "3. Each compatible node and the corresponding tree is put back into the priority queue.\n",
    "4. If no child nodes were found that could replace the current node, then we add each children with the current tree into the priority queue. (If we had to recurse into the child nodes, then the next tree that will get picked will be a different tree.)"
